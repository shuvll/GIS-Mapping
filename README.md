# Overview

My project here is to use the ArcGIS API to create a nice map of the world focused on California. I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create it. I had to use a couple of modules to complete it, but it was pretty simple to follow. I just had to set up the display and feed the information through the API with the respective modules.

# Development Environment

For this project I used the ArcGIS JS API which contains some AMD modules.
